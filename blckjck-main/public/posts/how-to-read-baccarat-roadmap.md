Walk into any baccarat table and you'll see something fascinating: electronic scoreboards displaying colorful grids, patterns, and symbols that look like ancient hieroglyphics. These are **baccarat roadmaps**—the pattern tracking systems casinos provide to help players spot trends.

But here's the question everyone asks: **Do they actually work? And more importantly, how do you read them?**

In this complete guide, you'll learn how to read all five baccarat roadmap types, understand what patterns mean (and what they don't), and use this information strategically in your play. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced player looking to master pattern recognition, this is your definitive resource.

## What Are Baccarat Roadmaps?

Baccarat roadmaps are **visual tracking systems** that record the outcome of every hand in a shoe. Unlike other casino games, baccarat actively encourages pattern tracking—casinos even provide electronic scoreboards and paper scorecards for this purpose.

### Why Casinos Display Roadmaps

This might seem counterintuitive. Why would casinos help you track patterns?

**The answer:** Because baccarat outcomes are independent events. Each hand has no memory of previous hands. Past results don't predict future outcomes—this is the **Gambler's Fallacy**.

However, roadmaps serve several purposes:
- **Entertainment value** - Players enjoy pattern recognition
- **Decision framework** - Helps players feel confident in their bets
- **Slows down play** - More time studying patterns = fewer hands per hour
- **Psychological comfort** - Players trust their "system" more than random betting

Casinos know that roadmaps don't change the house edge, but they make the game more engaging.

### The 5 Types of Baccarat Roadmaps

There are five distinct roadmap systems used in baccarat:

1. **Bead Plate (Bead Road)** - The simplest, most basic tracking
2. **Big Road** - The main roadmap everyone uses
3. **Big Eye Boy** - Derived pattern showing "choppiness"
4. **Small Road** - Similar to Big Eye Boy with different reference
5. **Cockroach Road** - The most abstract derived pattern

Each roadmap displays information differently, and understanding all five gives you complete insight into shoe trends.

## Bead Plate (Bead Road): The Foundation

The **Bead Plate** is the simplest and oldest roadmap system. It records results in the exact order they occurred, reading **top to bottom, then left to right**.

### How to Read the Bead Plate

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Red Circle (○)** | Banker win |
| **Blue Circle (○)** | Player win |
| **Green Slash (/)** | Tie |
| **Red dot inside circle** | Banker win with natural |
| **Blue dot inside circle** | Player win with natural |

### Bead Plate Example

```
Column 1: ○ ● ○ ○ / ○
         Red Blue Red Red Green Red
         (B) (P) (B) (B) (T) (B)

Column 2: ● ● ○ ○ ● ○
         Blue Blue Red Red Blue Red
         (P) (P) (B) (B) (P) (B)
```

**Reading it:** Banker, Player, Banker, Banker, Tie, Banker (column 1), then Player, Player, Banker, Banker, Player, Banker (column 2).

### What the Bead Plate Shows

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Complete record of every hand
- ✅ Easy to understand
- ✅ Shows exact sequence
- ✅ Includes ties

**Limitations:**
- ❌ Hard to spot patterns quickly
- ❌ Doesn't highlight streaks
- ❌ Not visual for trend analysis

The Bead Plate is your raw data source. All other roadmaps derive from this information.

## Big Road: The Main Roadmap

The **Big Road** is the most important roadmap and the one you'll use most often. It groups consecutive wins into columns, making streaks and trends visually obvious.

### How the Big Road Works

**Key principle:** Each column represents a streak of consecutive wins for one side.

**Recording rules:**
1. **Start a new column** when the outcome switches (Banker to Player or vice versa)
2. **Continue down the same column** for consecutive wins
3. **When a column is full (6 rows)**, turn right and continue at the bottom
4. **Ties don't get their own position** - they're marked with a green line through the last result

### Big Road Symbols

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Red Circle (○)** | Banker win |
| **Blue Circle (○)** | Player win |
| **Green line through circle** | Tie occurred on that hand |

### Big Road Pattern Example

```
Column 1: ○ ○ ○        (Banker streak - 3 wins)
         Red Red Red

Column 2: ● ●          (Player streak - 2 wins)  
         Blue Blue

Column 3: ○            (Banker single win)
         Red

Column 4: ● ● ● ●      (Player streak - 4 wins)
         Blue Blue Blue Blue
```

**This shows:** Banker won 3 times, then Player won twice, then Banker once, then Player won 4 times.

### What Patterns Look Like on the Big Road

**Strong Banker Trend:**
```
○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○
Red columns everywhere
```

**Choppy Shoe (Alternating):**
```
○ ● ○ ● ○ ● ○ ●
Red Blue Red Blue...
```

**Dragon Tail (Long Streak):**
```
○
○
○
○
○
○ → ○ → ○ → ○
When a streak hits 6, it turns right
```

### The "Dragon" Pattern

When a streak reaches the bottom of the Big Road (6 wins), it **turns right** and continues horizontally along the bottom row. This is called a **"Dragon"** or **"Dragon Tail."**

**Why it matters:** Dragons indicate very strong streaks and often influence betting behavior. Players tend to continue betting with the dragon.

## Big Eye Boy: The First Derived Road

**Big Eye Boy** doesn't show who won (Banker or Player). Instead, it shows whether the shoe is **predictable (streaky)** or **unpredictable (choppy)**.

### How Big Eye Boy Works

Big Eye Boy starts recording after the **second entry in the second column** of the Big Road.

**The logic:** Compare the current column to the column immediately to its left.

**Recording rules:**
- **Red circle** = Pattern is the same as previous column (predictable)
- **Blue circle** = Pattern is different from previous column (chaotic)

### Specific Rules

**Ask these questions in order:**

1. **Is there an entry to the left of the current position?**
   - Yes → Record Red
   - No → Go to question 2

2. **Is the previous column the same depth as the current column?**
   - Yes → Record Red
   - No → Record Blue

### Big Eye Boy Example

Looking at this Big Road:
```
○ ○ ○ ● ● ○
  ○   ●
```

The Big Eye Boy would show:
```
Red (columns 3 and 2 have same pattern)
Blue (column 4 different from column 3)
Red (column 5 same as column 4)
```

### What Big Eye Boy Tells You

**Red circles (predictable shoe):**
- Patterns are repeating
- Streaks are consistent
- "Follow the pattern" might work

**Blue circles (chaotic shoe):**
- No clear pattern
- Alternating frequently
- "Bet with the pattern" might not work

**Important:** This doesn't predict the NEXT hand. It just tells you whether past patterns have been consistent.

## Small Road: The Middle Derived Road

The **Small Road** works exactly like Big Eye Boy, but with one key difference:

**Big Eye Boy** compares the current column to the column **1 position to the left**.

**Small Road** compares the current column to the column **2 positions to the left**.

### Why This Matters

Small Road shows **longer-term predictability**. It's looking at patterns from further back in the shoe.

### Recording Rules

Same as Big Eye Boy, but:
- Compare current column to the column 2 positions left (instead of 1)
- Starts recording after the **third entry in the third column** of Big Road

### Visual Difference

```
Big Eye Boy:   Red Blue Red Red Blue
Small Road:    Blue Blue Red Blue Red
```

Even when Big Eye Boy shows a pattern, Small Road might show chaos (or vice versa).

## Cockroach Road: The Most Abstract

**Cockroach Road** (also called "Cockroach Pig") is the most abstract derived road.

**The difference:** Compares the current column to the column **3 positions to the left**.

### Recording Rules

Same concept as Big Eye Boy and Small Road:
- Compare current column to column 3 positions left
- Red = Predictable
- Blue = Chaotic
- Starts after the **fourth entry in the fourth column** of Big Road

### What All Three Derived Roads Together Show

When you look at Big Eye Boy, Small Road, and Cockroach Road together:

**All showing RED:**
- Shoe is highly predictable across short, medium, and long patterns
- Strong trend consistency
- "Ride the pattern" strategy might be effective

**All showing BLUE:**
- Shoe is completely chaotic across all timeframes
- No discernible patterns
- Random betting is as good as any strategy

**Mixed signals:**
- Some patterns predictable, others not
- Most common scenario
- Requires careful observation

## Common Baccarat Patterns and What They Mean

While patterns don't predict the future, understanding common formations helps you make informed decisions.

### The Streak (Dragon)

**What it looks like:**
```
Big Road: ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ → ○ → ○
```

**What players do:**
- Continue betting on the streaking side
- "Ride the dragon"
- Increase bet size as streak continues

**Reality:**
- Probability of streak continuing decreases with each win
- But streaks DO happen naturally
- The house edge remains 1.06% regardless

### The Chop

**What it looks like:**
```
Big Road: ○ ● ○ ● ○ ● ○ ●
         Red Blue Red Blue...
```

**What players do:**
- Bet the opposite of the last result
- Alternate Banker/Player bets
- Expect pattern to continue

**Reality:**
- Choppy shoes are common
- But the next hand could start a streak
- Pattern can change instantly

### The Two-Two Pattern

**What it looks like:**
```
Big Road: ○ ○ ● ● ○ ○ ● ●
```

**What players do:**
- Bet two hands on one side, then switch
- Follow the "double" pattern
- Adjust when pattern breaks

**Reality:**
- This is another form of pattern recognition
- Works until it doesn't
- No mathematical edge

### Trend Following vs. Trend Breaking

**Two opposite strategies:**

**Trend Following (Momentum):**
- Bet with the current pattern
- If Banker is streaking, bet Banker
- "The trend is your friend"

**Trend Breaking (Mean Reversion):**
- Bet against extreme patterns
- After a long Banker streak, bet Player
- "What goes up must come down"

**Which is better?** Neither. Both have the same expected value because each hand is independent.

## The Mathematics: Do Patterns Actually Work?

Here's the truth about baccarat pattern recognition:

### Each Hand is Independent

**The math:**
- Banker wins: 45.86% of the time
- Player wins: 44.62% of the time
- Tie: 9.52% of the time

**These probabilities never change**, regardless of what happened in previous hands.

### The Gambler's Fallacy

If Banker has won 10 times in a row:
- ❌ Wrong thinking: "Player is due to win"
- ✅ Reality: Banker still has 45.86% chance, Player has 44.62%

The cards don't remember previous results.

### Then Why Do Patterns Exist?

**Short answer:** Variance.

In any random sequence, patterns will naturally emerge:
- Streaks happen
- Alternating runs occur
- Clusters form

This is **statistical noise**, not predictive information.

### The Only Real Edge: Banker Bet

The **ONLY mathematically favorable decision** in baccarat:

**Always bet Banker** (when possible):
- Banker wins 50.68% of hands (excluding ties)
- Player wins 49.32% of hands (excluding ties)
- This slight edge comes from Banker drawing rules

**The house edge:**
- Banker bet: 1.06% (after 5% commission)
- Player bet: 1.24%
- Tie bet: 14.36% (never bet this)

Betting Banker every hand is optimal strategy, regardless of patterns.

## How to Use Roadmaps in Your Play

Roadmaps won't give you a mathematical edge, but they can help in other ways:

### 1. Entertainment and Engagement

Pattern tracking makes the game more interesting:
- Gives you something to analyze
- Makes you feel involved
- Provides decision framework
- Enhances the experience

**This is valuable!** If you're going to play baccarat for entertainment, roadmaps make it more enjoyable.

### 2. Bankroll Management

Use patterns to manage your session:

**During streaks:**
- Consider smaller bets
- Long streaks often mean high variance
- Protect your bankroll

**During chop:**
- Standard bet sizing
- Lower variance = steadier play

### 3. Psychological Confidence

Some players perform better with a system:
- Reduces emotional decisions
- Prevents tilt
- Provides structure

If pattern following helps you play disciplined, it has value (even if not mathematical).

### 4. Spotting Shoe Composition Changes

While each hand is independent, shoe composition DOES matter:

**Late in the shoe:**
- Fewer high cards = slightly favors Player
- Fewer low cards = slightly favors Banker
- These effects are tiny but real

Roadmaps help you track position in the shoe.

## Practice Reading Roadmaps

The best way to learn is by practicing with real shoes. Here's how:

### Step 1: Find Live Baccarat

**Online casinos:**
- Most have live dealer baccarat
- Roadmaps displayed on screen
- Watch without betting

**Physical casinos:**
- Observe tables
- Take notes on paper scorecards
- Don't feel pressure to play

### Step 2: Focus on One Roadmap First

Start with **Big Road only**:
1. Watch 50 hands
2. Predict the pattern type (streak, chop, etc.)
3. See if your prediction holds

Don't try to predict winners—just identify patterns.

### Step 3: Add Derived Roads

Once comfortable with Big Road:
1. Compare Big Eye Boy to actual patterns
2. Notice when it turns red vs. blue
3. Observe if "predictable" shoes actually have cleaner patterns

### Step 4: Practice Without Money

**Use virtual chips:**
- Track imaginary bets
- Test different strategies
- Learn without risk

## Common Roadmap Mistakes

Avoid these errors that cost players money:

### Mistake #1: Betting Ties Because of "Gaps"

❌ **Wrong:** "It's been 40 hands without a tie. A tie is due!"

✅ **Reality:** Ties still have 9.52% probability. No amount of waiting changes this.

### Mistake #2: Doubling Down on Broken Patterns

❌ **Wrong:** "Banker has won 8 times. I'll bet big on Player because the streak must end."

✅ **Reality:** Each hand is independent. The streak could continue.

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the House Edge

❌ **Wrong:** "I have a pattern system that beats baccarat."

✅ **Reality:** The house edge applies to every bet. No pattern system overcomes it.

### Mistake #4: Overcomplicating with All 5 Roadmaps

❌ **Wrong:** "I need to analyze all 5 roadmaps before every bet."

✅ **Reality:** Big Road is sufficient for most purposes. Derived roads add minimal value.

### Mistake #5: Chasing Losses with "System" Bets

❌ **Wrong:** "My system says to double my bet after a loss."

✅ **Reality:** Martingale and similar systems don't change the house edge. They just risk more.

## Baccarat Roadmap FAQ

### Can roadmaps predict the next hand?

No. Each hand is mathematically independent. Roadmaps show past results, not future outcomes.

### Why do casinos provide roadmaps if they don't work?

Because they increase player engagement without changing the house edge. Players enjoy pattern recognition, and it slows down play (fewer hands per hour = less house edge extraction).

### Which roadmap is most useful?

The **Big Road** is the most practical. It clearly shows streaks and patterns. Derived roads (Big Eye Boy, Small Road, Cockroach Road) add complexity without much value.

### Do professional baccarat players use roadmaps?

Some do for entertainment or psychological confidence, but not because they believe patterns predict outcomes. Professionals focus on **betting Banker consistently** and **managing bankroll**.

### What's the best baccarat strategy?

**Always bet Banker** (1.06% house edge) instead of Player (1.24% house edge). Never bet Tie (14.36% house edge). This is optimal strategy regardless of roadmap patterns.

### Can edge sorting or card counting beat baccarat?

**Edge sorting** (identifying card backs) is illegal and considered cheating. **Card counting** in baccarat provides minimal advantage (0.05-0.1% at best) and requires perfect tracking of every card. Not practical for most players.

### How do I know if a shoe is "hot" or "cold"?

Shoes aren't hot or cold—this is superstition. **Variance** creates streaks and patterns, but the underlying probabilities never change.

### Should I bet with or against a trend?

Neither strategy has a mathematical advantage. Both are equally valid from a probability standpoint. Choose whichever feels more comfortable to you.

### Do online baccarat games use roadmaps?

Yes, most live dealer baccarat games display all roadmaps. RNG (random number generator) baccarat often shows simplified roadmaps or none at all.

### Can I trust casino roadmaps?

Yes, casinos have no incentive to manipulate roadmaps. They display accurate past results because the house edge guarantees profit long-term regardless of patterns.
